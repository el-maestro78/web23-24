### Project Goal: 
The goal of this project is to develop a collaborative 
system for recording requests for assistance(essential goods) and 
addressing the needs of a community affected by a natural disaster(e.g., flood, earthquake, etc.). 
Through the platform, a citizen can report that they have specific needs
for various items (e.g., water, food, medicine) or declare that they have 
a surplus and can donate specific items.
